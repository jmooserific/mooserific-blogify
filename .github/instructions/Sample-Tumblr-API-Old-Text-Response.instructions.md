During our most recent trip to Lowes, we picked up some new chrome door fixtures. I had big plans to change out the whole first floor today.  A tall order with three bedroom doors, two bathroom doors, and two closet doors.  After easily replacing one door hinge and two door handles today, I recognized though that once again I was putting the cart before the horse.  Although the change was quick and easy, I realized that the doors and trim really needs to be painted first. Why put them on and then have to take them off again when we paint? That’s just silly! So instead of completing this project, I got online and started dreaming about other changes. Of course we “need” curtains for the living room and master bedroom, new master bedroom furniture, a bird feeder, and so many other things.  Bouncing around between Pottery Barn, Crate &amp; Barrel and Amazon, I very quickly lost an hour or two.  I reined myself in though, and with John’s encouragement thought about changes we really need to make first.  Thus, my brain’s now back where it should be and I’m thinking about crown molding and trim.  With our bedroom as major project number one, we first need to install trim and then focus on painting.  (Some light and cheery Martha “whites” for our northern room.)  We’re thinking an Arts and Crafts style trim would best suit us.  I think I found a nice model too.  <a href=\"denied:ttp://homeforthebetter.blogspot.com/\" title=\"Home for the Better\" target=\"_blank\">Another young couple</a> with a home lacking in these details had just the right example.<br><br> Anyway,  that’s blog post number one.  I think I’ll bundle up now and lovingly toss snow balls at John while he shovels our driveway and walk.  I may take some snow day pictures too.</p>",
